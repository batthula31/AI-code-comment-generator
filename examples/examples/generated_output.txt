Example 3: Output from Streamlit Application
============================================

Model Used:
CodeT5 Base (Pre-trained)

Generated Summary / Docstring:
------------------------------
Broken_function(x,y)Broken_function(x,y)Broken_function(x,y)
Broken_function(x,y)Broken_function(x,y)Broken_function(x,y)
Broken_function(x,y)Broken_function(x,y)Broken_function(x)

Observation:
The generated output consists of repeated tokens and does not form a
meaningful natural language description. This behavior indicates that
the base CodeT5 model was not fine-tuned for the task and was evaluated
on a very small mock dataset.

Error & Warning Detection:
--------------------------
❌ Syntax Error Detected
- Line 19: expected ':'

Fix Suggestions:
----------------
Check for missing colons (:), unmatched parentheses, or indentation errors.

Interpretation:
---------------
This example demonstrates the limitations of using a base pre-trained
model without task-specific fine-tuning. While the model attempts to
generate output, it fails to produce coherent comments. However, the
system successfully detects syntax errors and provides actionable
debugging guidance, highlighting the importance of combining model
outputs with rule-based validation.
